FuckWebp is a simple script that allows users to convert every WebP image file found inside the same folder as the script. 
This script is designed to be kept in the download folder. Once images are downloaded, execute:

python FuckWebp.py

to convert every WebP into PNG.

You can easily execute this command by navigating to the download folder (if the script is present)
and entering the command in the directory file path, then pressing Enter on the keyboard.

Please keep in mind that WebP achieves more efficient compression compared to other formats like JPEG and PNG, which means smaller file sizes for the same image quality. This can significantly reduce the amount of data needed to store and transmit images, which improves website load times and reduces bandwidth usage. Most modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera, support WebP. However, some older browsers might not support it, which can necessitate fallback options for compatibility. Because WebP is quite recent, introduced by Google in 2010, which is relatively recent compared to older formats like JPEG (introduced in 1992) and PNG (introduced in 1996). This means that many established image editing software tools had already standardized on supporting older formats before WebP was introduced. To this day, many image software still doesn't support WebP, which is why I made this script.
